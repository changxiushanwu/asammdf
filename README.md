*asammdf* is a fast parser and editor for ASAM (Associtation for Standardisation of Automation and Measuring Systems) MDF (Measurement Data Format) files. 

*asammdf* supports MDF versions 2 (.dat), 3 (.mdf) and 4 (.mf4). 

*asammdf* works on Python 2.7, and Python >= 3.4

*asammdf* was tested succesfully on both Linux and Windows

# Project goals
The main goals for this library are:

* to be faster than the other Python based mdf libraries
* to have clean and easy to understand code base
* to have minimal 3-rd party dependencies

# Features

* create new mdf files from scratch
* append new channels
* read unsorted MDF v3 and v4 files
* read CAN bus logging files
* filter a subset of channels from original mdf file
* cut measurement to specified time interval
* convert to different mdf version
* export to Excel, HDF5, Matlab and CSV
* merge multiple files sharing the same internal structure
* read and save mdf version 4.10 files containing zipped data blocks
* space optimizations for saved files (no duplicated blocks)
* split large data blocks (configurable size) for mdf version 4
* full support (read, append, save) for the following map types (multidimensional array channels):

    * mdf version 3 channels with CDBLOCK
    * mdf version 4 structure channel composition
    * mdf version 4 channel arrays with CNTemplate storage and one of the array types:
    
        * 0 - array
        * 1 - scaling axis
        * 2 - look-up
        
* add and extract attachments for mdf version 4
* handle large files (for example merging two fileas, each with 14000 channels and 5GB size, on a RaspberryPi) using *memory* = *minimum* argument
* extract channel data, master channel and extra channel information as *Signal* objects for unified operations with v3 and v4 files
* time domain operation using the *Signal* class

    * Pandas data frames are good if all the channels have the same time based
    * a measurement will usually have channels from different sources at different rates
    * the *Signal* class facilitates operations with such channels

# Major features not implemented (yet)

* for version 3

    * functionality related to sample reduction block
    
* for version 4

    * functionality related to sample reduction block
    * handling of channel hierarchy
    * full handling of bus logging measurements
    * handling of unfinished measurements (mdf 4)
    * full support for remaining mdf 4 channel arrays types
    * xml schema for MDBLOCK
    * full handling of event blocks
    * channels with default X axis
    * chanenls with reference to attachment

# Usage

```python
   from asammdf import MDF
   
   mdf = MDF('sample.mdf')
   speed = mdf.get('WheelSpeed')
   speed.plot()
   
   important_signals = ['WheelSpeed', 'VehicleSpeed', 'VehicleAcceleration']
   # get short measurement with a subset of channels from 10s to 12s 
   short = mdf.filter(important_signals).cut(start=10, stop=12)
   
   # convert to version 4.10 and save to disk
   short.convert('4.10').save('important signals.mf4')
   
   # plot some channels from a huge file
   efficient = MDF('huge.mf4', , memory='minimum')
   for signal in efficient.select(['Sensor1', 'Voltage3']):
       signal.plot()
   
```
